"""Imported browser cookies, stored as a Playwright ``storageState`` and applied
to the agent's ``playwright-cli`` sessions.

The dashboard user exports cookies from the browser where they are already
logged in and imports them here; the gateway normalises them to Playwright's
cookie shape and writes one owner-only ``storageState`` file under the data
home. That file is **bind-masked out of every agent sandbox**
(``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES``): the agent must never be able to read a
session cookie off disk, and a spawned shell's ``open()`` never routes through
the tool gate, so only the OS mask holds. The cookies still have to reach the
agent's browser. Three invariants decide how:

1. **The agent's browser daemon always runs inside the agent's sandbox**,
   started by the agent's own command exactly as before this feature. The
   gateway never starts a daemon for an agent session: a gateway-privileged
   daemon driven by the agent (``upload <masked path>``, ``state-save``) would
   be a sandbox escape.
2. **No config the agent or its daemon reads names the hidden file.** The
   launch config (:func:`kiro_crew.browser_cli.launch.desired_config`) stays
   engine-only; there is no second, gateway-side config.
3. **Cookies reach a daemon only through its control socket, as data.** The
   gateway runs the CLI client ``playwright-cli -s=<kc-name> cookie-set ...``
   once per cookie with that session's socket/registry directories
   (:func:`_session_env`), and the daemon does ``context.addCookies``. It opens
   no file. Two entry points: the import handler injects into every live
   ``kc-*`` session at once (:func:`inject_into_live_sessions`), and a
   gateway-side :class:`SessionWatcher` thread injects into every daemon
   socket that appears afterwards, so a session the agent starts later carries
   the cookies too. The clear handler runs ``cookie-clear`` on the live
   sessions (:func:`clear_live_sessions`) and resets the watcher's record.

**Residuals, stated plainly.** (i) The watcher polls every
:data:`WATCH_INTERVAL_S` seconds, so the very first navigation of a brand-new
session can run before its cookies land (at most one interval late; the next
navigation has them). (ii) Each ``cookie-set`` carries the cookie's name and
value in the CLI client's argv, visible for the milliseconds that process lives
to same-UID processes reading ``/proc`` -- the alternative, a file the daemon
opens, is exactly what invariant 2 forbids, and the daemon's socket protocol
offers no stdin path for a cookie. The daemon's reply echoes the value too,
which is why an injection failure is reported by return code alone and never by
its output.

**Three import shapes are accepted**, because that is what the browsers and
their export extensions actually produce:

1. A Playwright ``storageState`` object (``{"cookies": [...], "origins": [...]}``)
   -- what ``playwright-cli state-save`` writes, so a round-trip is lossless.
2. A bare JSON array of cookie objects -- the Cookie-Editor / EditThisCookie /
   "Get cookies.txt" extension export. Field names differ from Playwright's
   (``expirationDate`` for the expiry, a wider ``sameSite`` vocabulary), so they
   are normalised.
3. Netscape ``cookies.txt`` -- the tab-separated format ``curl``/``wget`` and
   the "Get cookies.txt" extension emit, including the ``#HttpOnly_`` domain
   prefix convention.

Every cookie is normalised to the Playwright shape: ``name``, ``value``,
``domain``, ``path``, ``expires`` (a float, or ``-1`` for a session cookie),
``httpOnly``, ``secure``, ``sameSite`` in ``{"Strict", "Lax", "None"}``. Already
expired cookies are dropped. Every failure raises :class:`CookieImportError`
with a message meant to be shown to the user.

**Values never leave.** :func:`storage_state_summary` reports counts, domains
and the earliest expiry, and nothing here ever returns or logs a cookie value.
The agent is told (see ``docs/browser-control.md``) that imported cookies apply
to new sessions on their own and that it must never read the storage-state file
-- and the sandbox mask is what makes that last sentence a fact rather than an
instruction.
